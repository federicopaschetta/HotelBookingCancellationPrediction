# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes data mining techniques to predict hotel booking cancellations. The goal is to enable hotels to better manage resources, improve revenue forecasting, and minimize losses caused by cancellations. The analysis covers various phases including descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analyses.

## Project Description
The project is part of a Data Mining course at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and aims to explore the intricacies of hotel booking behaviors to predict cancellations effectively. Using the `HOTEL_BOOKINGS.csv` dataset, this analysis delves into different aspects such as lead times, booking changes, deposit types, and customer origin to identify patterns correlating with cancellation probabilities.

### Objectives
- Perform comprehensive data analysis to understand trends and patterns in hotel booking cancellations.
- Develop predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network) to forecast cancellations.
- Propose strategic recommendations to reduce cancellation rates and optimize overbooking.

## Data Source
The primary dataset used is `HOTEL_BOOKINGS.csv`, originally sourced from a Kaggle dataset published by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It consists of 119,390 entries and details on reservations for a city hotel and a resort hotel.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hotel-cancellation-prediction.git
cd hotel-cancellation-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the analysis:

```bash
python script.py
```

This script will execute the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction phases. The results and plots will be saved in the specified directories within the project.
